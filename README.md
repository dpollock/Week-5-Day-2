create a "CREATE TABLE" statement for pandas. Pandas have a name, gender (M/F), belong to a zoo, weight in lbs, and have a personality where zoo keepers describe their traits/likes/dislikes.

Don't forget the Primary Key and the CreatedAt/UpdatedAt!

Part 2

Zoo keepers would like to find the two largest pandas, one male and one female. Please write the SQL queries to find that information.
